## This is a todo app in vanilla js.

A exercice we got during salt.
Uses localStorage to store todos and sort them in order to when they was added. The sorting new > old can be reversed. 

Completed Todos are moved to bottom and marked with a strike.
When a todo is makrked as done, it can be removed. 

## To run
Simply clone this repo and open the index.html in browser.
